# Final-Project

This project explores the 2018 season for the Harvard Football defense. Users can choose which defensive they want to see statistics on, and the plot illustrates a boxplot that compiles every single time that call was made in the 2018 season. 

Thank you to the Harvard Football team for allowing me to work with this data set privately.
